Summary: A quick introduction to Pelican as I rebuild my Notes site

# An Introduction to Pelican with Notes
About a year ago, I made a personal notes static site to be hosted using GitHub
Pages --- but I never got around to writing much on it because I got to about
80% percent of the way there before giving up on the remaining things at hand.

Now, a year later, and another year around the horizon, I decided to try out a
little something familiar, but new at the same time.

My goals were clear, I wanted:
* To replace Hugo (despite how fantastic it is)
* To try out Pelican and it's offerings
* Rebuild my static site with a little more control over the layouts, designs
and overall structure (albeit with a bit of "inspiration" from other sources).
* A public notebook for random tech-or-non-tech musings.


## Building on Pelican
Pelican is great and uses a lot of familiar technology to get things done, such
as the popular Jinja2 and Markdown packages - for everything I need. Further, it
has some nice tooling as well which makes building, testing and even publishing
a breeze.
