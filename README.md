# Notes
A collection of my notes.


## Setting-Up
* The project depends on `Python 3.10.8`
* Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
* `pelican` to generate files
* `invoke livereload` to work locally
* Push a new commit after `pelican` to publish


## Plug-ins:
- [Pelican Series](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/series) - this allows us
to structure posts as an ordered "series"
- [Pelican Sitemap](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/sitemap) - this allows us
to automatically generate and update sitemaps


## TODO:
- Add search - probably with https://github.com/pelican-plugins/search

Made with Pelican - https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html
